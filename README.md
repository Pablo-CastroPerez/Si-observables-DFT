# Silicon: DFT Simulation and Observable Extraction

This repository contains input files, scripts, and results for a density functional theory (DFT) study of **Silicon**, performed with **Quantum ESPRESSO**. The goal is to compute observables such as the bulk modulus, equilibrium volume, and equilibrium energy by fitting total energies to several equations of state (EOS).  

For details, see the results PDF [`Si_observables_results.pdf`](./Si_observables_results.pdf).

This was done for educational purposes only and contain certain oversimplifications, such as calculating the sound speed directly from the bulk modulus instead of elastic coefficients. The results are not meant to be used as rigorous data.
